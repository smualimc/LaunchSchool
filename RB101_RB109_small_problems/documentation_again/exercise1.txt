Locate the ruby documentation for methods File::path and File#path. How are they different?

File::path returns just the string representation of a path
  File.path("/dev/null")          #=> "/dev/null"

File#path returns the pathname used to create a specific file as a string.
  File.new("testfile").path               #=> "testfile"
